# Luminance Technology  Project

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Deployed URL
https://max-verstappen-f1profile.netlify.app/

## Background
This project is designed to be a single webpage in an F1 fan blog, or similar, with pages for every driver. The background colour and team logo would change depending on team, and the name graphics based on national colours. The page contains information fetched from the following API: https://ergast.com/mrd/ and so will update after every race / championship. Likewise, after a season has ended, the graphs should update with the most recent season.

## Functionality
* Up-to-date biography information and statistics.
* Image carousel
* Embedded video
* Up-to-date graphs based on previous season data
* Links to other sites


## Limitations
With more time, I would look to improve the responsive functionality of the app, particularly in regards to resizing the graphs and the image carousel. In it's current state, it works as a mobile version and as a web version, but can run into some problems when transitioning between the two. I would also like to create a chatbox to search for race results from the same API as the other information is pulled from. I would look to include more extensive statistics.
